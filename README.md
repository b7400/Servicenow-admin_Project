This is my PDI projects for Loaner Vehicle app ServiceNow projects.
Loaner Vehicle Request and Inventory Management Project

Business Requirements and Goals:
Various contractors who need a loaner vehicle would like to be able to automate the process of requesting vehicles from the vehicle warehouse. They would like to move away from the current manual process as it has been a struggle to get what they need in a timely manner which directly affects their ability to perform their day-to-day activities. 

Functional Overview:
The proposed Loaner Vehicle Request and Inventory Management Project aims to solution current issues of maintaining a catalog of all vehicles that are available, inventory tracking, and will also introduce a process that incorporates approval and delivery tasks into one flow.
